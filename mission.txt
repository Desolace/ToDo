Create a Todo application!
- Use jQuery and the things we've learned so far. You may
  also need to dive into some things we haven't covered;
  practice your google-fu!
- Your Todo application should have the following features
    - Add a Todo to the list
    - Delete a Todo from the list
    - Mark a Todo as "completed"
    - Let the user filter the list so that...
        a. all todos are visible
        b. only the completed todos are visible
        c. only the unfinished todos are visible
